# Executable_NASA_CEA
A code snippet that allows NASA CEA to be part of an optimization problem, allowing multiple runs of NASA CEA automated for a custom range of pressure and oxidizer fuel ratio for a given fuel and oxidizer choice..

The NASA Computer program CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications) calculates chemical equilibrium compositions and properties of complex mixtures (Read more at : https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/research-and-engineering/ceaweb/). 
NASA CEA requires user input for different propellant combinations, pressure vales or Oxidizer-Fuel ratios. In an optimization problem, however, it requires user input at every potential solution, extending simulation.

This code snippet allows automation of the user input process and allows faster simulation. 

To use the code snippet it is important to have the CEA.exe on your system (the online NASA CEA is not compatible). 
The code can be easily edited to include the propellant combination of your choice.
